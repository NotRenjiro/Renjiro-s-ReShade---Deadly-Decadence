A collection of Shader presets, designed to enhance Dark Deceptions graphics.


	Dark Deception - Renjiro's ReShade Collection /// Deadly Decadence
	__________________________________________________________________


	A collection of Shader presets, created by Renjiro.
	The goal is to improve Dark Deceptions visual quality, because the original color schemes look rather bland.

	NOTE:	Do not use these in areas that they are not meant for!
